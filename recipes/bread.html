        <p>This delicious fetta pizza with have your stomach full and wishing you had more as you lick your fingers.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Warm Water</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Non-instant yeast</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate the yeast. Combine 1 cup of warm water, yeast, and 1 tbsp of granulated shugar in your mixing bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes or until the yeast has puffed up to cover the entire surface of the water.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the sugar, oil, salt, and flour; then mix using an electric mixer until it is well combined, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Knead the bread.  If you use a dough hook mixer, knead for 7 minutes, or for 10-11 minutes if kneading by hand.</li>
            <li>Place your dough in an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and leave it alone for a while. Once the dough is pushing out of the bowl, it's ready.</li>
            <li>Punch that dough!  No, really...punch it. Punching the dough down quickly releases any air pockets and helps your bread have a more consistent rise and texture.  Shape the dough into an oblong ball and then place it into a greased bread pan.</li>
            <li>Let it rise again, it should only take about 30 minutes this time to fill the pan.</li>
            <li>Bake the bread for about 30-40 minutes on 350 degrees.  Use a digital thermometor to chech the temperate, it is done with the internal temperature of the bread is 195ish degrees.</li>
        </ol>
